# world_time

This flutter project is an application for displaying current time in different part of the world. 
A user is allowed to select from a list of location and the appropriate time in the city is displayed.
The background color also changes based on the time of the day.
The external endpoint from which the current time was consumed is: "http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/".

A Nexus 6 API 28 android emulator was used for displaying the pages of the app.
